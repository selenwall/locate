# Geolocation Game - Hitta platsen!

A multiplayer geolocation game based on the hitta repository, where players take photos with AI object detection and challenge each other to find the exact location.

## ðŸŽ® Play the Game

**Live Demo**: https://selenwall.github.io/locate/

## Game Rules

1. **Photo Capture**: One player takes a photo of objects at their current location
2. **AI Detection**: The YOLO model identifies objects in the photo (shown in live view)
3. **Challenge**: The identified objects are sent to the other player via messaging
4. **Location Hunt**: The other player has 3 minutes to get within 5 meters of the photo location
5. **Scoring**: 
   - 3 points if found within 1 minute
   - 2 points if found within 2 minutes  
   - 1 point if found within 3 minutes

## Features
